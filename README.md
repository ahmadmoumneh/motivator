# Motivator

Application written in ReactJS based on an original concept of a motivator for a user activity. A user logs his or her positive and negative actions related to a certain activity that will eventually contribute in his or her motivation towards this activity.

A user can view a chart displaying the ratio between positive and negative actions of an activity throughout the days he or she is active on represented by horizontal bars.
